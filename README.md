# SmartKiosk
The advancements in Human-Computer Interaction and IoT-based technologies make it imperative to build and deploy user friendly applications
to facilitate people and contribute largely to the automated world. Self-ordering kiosk, as the name indicates, is developed to enable customers
at restaurants and remote spaces to place their orders in an effecient and convenient manner. Both cash and cashless payment solutions are 
integrated with the kiosk, providing a real-time expereince to the users and the restaurant staff. The live monitoring of the sales and inventory 
data and reports generation through a web portal adds to the top of resource management. The application is designed in such a way that the user 
spends least possible time for placing a single order while making it a near-to-perfect solution for places having big queues. Being in the production 
environment, the machine is still under the user-testing phase of deplyoment. Restaurants anywhere can customize the standalone machine according 
to their specifications.
